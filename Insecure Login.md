Broken Authentication Insecure Login Forms refers to a class of vulnerabilities where authentication mechanisms (like login forms) are improperly implemented, allowing attackers
to bypass authentication, hijack sessions, or perform unauthorized actions.
These vulnerabilities are often part of the OWASP Top 10 security risks, specifically under the "Broken Authentication" category.
Insecure login forms are common entry points for attackers looking to exploit weak security in web applications. 

In a bWAPP (Buggy Web Application) environment, you can explore various security vulnerabilities, including Broken Authentication and Insecure Login Forms, in a controlled, ethical, and legal way for educational purposes.

bWAPP is a deliberately insecure web application designed to teach web security. It has a variety of vulnerabilities that you can test and explore, such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Broken Authentication.

For educational purposes only, here's how you can work with Broken Authentication vulnerabilities in bWAPP, particularly focusing on Insecure Login Forms:
