Broken Authentication Insecure Login Forms refers to a class of vulnerabilities where authentication mechanisms (like login forms) are improperly implemented, allowing attackers
to bypass authentication, hijack sessions, or perform unauthorized actions.
These vulnerabilities are often part of the OWASP Top 10 security risks, specifically under the "Broken Authentication" category.
Insecure login forms are common entry points for attackers looking to exploit weak security in web applications.
